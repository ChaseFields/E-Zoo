A common way of hunting is to capture a seal by bumping it off the sheet of ice it sits on.</p>

To catch fish and other food, they will dive over 25 meters below the water and are able to stay under about four minutes. There can be hundreds of them at a time going fishing together! </p>

This bird takes fishing trips of 10 to 20 days and can cover 10,000 kilometers using very little effort. Their huge wingspan allows the wind to carry them rathern than a lot of flapping. Their babies are born large. It only takes 1 year for a new born Albatross to be fully grown.</p>

One bite could kill an elephant or up to 20 grown men! It is the only snake that makes a nest for its eggs. The mother will stay with the eggs until they hatch. Its only predator is the mongoose, because it is immune to the venom.</p>

            <p>Found in Malaysia, the asian Tapir is a uniquely shaped mammal. They usually weigh between 500 and 700 pounds, but can weigh over 1000 pounds. They can't see well, but can smell and hear very well! They eat only plants. They move slowly through the forest eating and smelling for other creatures. A tapir can run fast and use its powerful jaws and sharp teeth to defend itself. As a result the Tapir has few predators.</p>

            <h2>Sloth</h2>
            <p>The famous tree dwelling mammal featured in Disney's Zootopia, sloths are one of the slowest moving animals on earth. What makes them so slow? Sloths have a 4 part stomach that very slowly digests the tough leaves they eat. It can take up to a month to digest a meal. With all this energy used for digestion, they have little energy to move around. Their tongue can extend to almost a foot long! and is very useful for collecting food.</p>

            <h2>Jaguar</h2>
            <p>This big cat is the largest cat in the americas. It is a swift hunter and will hide its prey in trees for safe keeping. Deer, pigs, rodents and anacondas could be on the jag menu. Like tigers they are at home in dense rain forests and enjoy swimming. They live, roam, and hunt alone, only coming together to mate. Its bite is even stronger than a lion. It looks similar to the african leopard, but is larger and  has small spots inside the circles of it's fur. </p>

            <h2>Anaconda</h2>
            <p>Though a python can grow longer, the Anaconda is the heaviest and thickest snake in the world, weighing up to 550 pounds! It will eat any animal it can catch, from small rodents to deer and capybara. It squeezes its prey, rather than giving them venom. Its flexible jaw and throat muscles allow it to eat animals whole, without chewing. After a large meal, it may not eat for weeks. Unlike many snakes, Anacondas do not lay eggs, but give birth to live young. </p>

            <h2>Piranha</h2>
            <p>On average, it is only 8 to 10 inches long. But this fish packs a bite! The "red belly piranha" has razor sharp teeth and fierce biting power. Especially in shallow water, these fish swim and hunt in groups of up to 100 called "shoals". These shoals are useful for hunting, but are also important for protection against predators. Though dangerous to larger animals, it much more often attacks small prey. </p>

            <h2>Boto</h2>
            <p>The boto is the largest kind of amazon river dolphin. When the amazon floods, the waters cover many of the trees. The boto has no problem moving its way through the flooded forest. It can bend its body in amazing ways to move around. The long snout comes in handy for checking the river bed for food or darting through branches for small fish. Males can become a  distinct pink color. This pink color makes them attractive to female botos.</p>

            <h2>Tortoise</h2>
            <p>18 islands off the coast Ecuador make up the Galapagos Islands. The islands were named after their giant tortoise. It is the largest tortoise in the world with some reaching over 5 feet in length and weiging 550 pounds! They can also live to over 100 years old. They have very easy lives, grazing on grass and other plant life, and sleeping around 16 hours a day. They digest very slowly and have water storage inside them, so they can go a year without eating or drinking if needed.</p>
